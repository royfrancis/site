Images can be arranged side by side in Quarto using the `columns` layout. Here's how you can do it:

```
::: {#fig-mylabel layout-ncol=2}

![Caption for figure 1](featured.webp)

![Caption for figure 2](featured.webp)

This is a common caption.

```

::: {#fig-mylabel layout-ncol=2}

![Caption for figure 1](featured.webp)
